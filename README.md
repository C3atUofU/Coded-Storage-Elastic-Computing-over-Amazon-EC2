# Coded-Storage-Elastic-Computing-over-Amazon-EC2

This is an design and implementation of Coded Storage Elastic Computing with heterogenous computing speed over Amazon EC2. The applications are power iteration and linear regression.

Run file "node_set_up.sh" to setup 20 nodes for Amazon EC2 instance. 

The use of files are as follows.

GenSendData.py : data generation
speed_test_mpi.py : speed testing for machines
CEC_Stragglers_Power.py: power iteration codes
CEC_Stragglers_LinReg.py : linear regression codes
